**CASS**

CASS is a system that uses a camera to read a person's facial expressions and interpret their emotions. This can be very useful, especially in sales situations and for providing feedback on advertisements. The system is based on standalone units that make local estimations. By sending information to a cloud of interconnected units, even better results can be achieved.
